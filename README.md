# UART-Device-Driver-for-STM32F-microcontroller
This project include line of codes for Driver Development for UART peripherial for STM32Fxxx microcontroller, 
specifically it is development and tried flashing on STM32F446re Nucleo Board, but can be used by any family of Cortex M processor boards.
Thankyou!!
